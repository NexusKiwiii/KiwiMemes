# KiwiMemes

Create simple meme-videos

For each meme (in the `memes` folder) it will take a random background video (from the `backgrounds` folder).
Based on your `config.json` it will remove the background audio.
## Installation

You only need moviepy and the script

```bash
    pip install moviepy
```
    
after downloading you have to create a `config.json` in the same directory. Create a `memes` and `backgrounds` folder where you put all the backgrounds and memes. They dont need any specific name or smth.

After running the script it will automatically create a output folder with the meme-videos.
